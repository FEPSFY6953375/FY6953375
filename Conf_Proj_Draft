Main Body
Intro (how we got here, why write the article, what is space debris, sources, what this article does):
Dealing with waste has been a constant and evolving challenge opposing industrialisation and development. Strategies and mitigative measures can be employed to reduce the negative effects of waste on earth, but the situation becomes much more complex when we consider human development in space. The ‘industrial waste’ that we must deal with in space is Orbital Debris, which can cause huge amounts of damage if they impact the satellites and space stations. This paper will determine the extent to which orbital debris could hinder efforts to expand human presence and development in space, and analyse the active and proposed plans to mitigate the effects of orbital debris.
Sources of Debris:
The aforementioned debris is primarily created when excess rocket parts are ejected during the launch process, and when satellites are destroyed or decommissioned ***. However, the main source of risk comes from the potential for these pieces of debris to collide and multiply, which creates a positive feedback loop of increasingly crowded and polluted space. The potential for this effect to spiral out of control, rendering some orbits unusable, is called the Kessler Syndrome ***.
Orbital debris collisions is  a risk to objects in orbit around the earth. While this phenomenon has been explored in media, most notably in 2013’s ‘Gravity’, the threat it poses is far from fiction. The International Space Station has had to manoeuvre to avoid debris 32 times since 1999 ***, and damage from minor collisions are well documented. Fig 1 demonstrates how even small debris can puncture through multiple layers of protection.
As the problem of orbit debris continues to worsen through increased launches, orbit collisions, and the intentional destruction of satellites, the constraints on satellite design will increase, life expectancy will decrease, and maintenance requirements increase drastically. This will put a dampening effect on new launches and orbital developments. In their paper, ‘An economic “Kessler Syndrome”: A dynamic model of earth orbit debris’ (2018), Adilov, Alexander and Cunningham posit that the falling profitability of new satellites due to the Kessler Syndrome will render certain orbits economically unusable long before they become physically unusable due to debris.
