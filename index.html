					Humanity utilises space for a variety of purposes, including communication, scientific study, 
					and defence. As on earth, industrial utilisation of this environment creates waste. In orbit,
					this waste, or space debris, threatens to damage crucial infrastructure if collisions occur. This 
					problem has been documented as early on as 1978, but legal and technological solutions have 
					only ramped up in the last decade, likely due to an increased interest in commercial space 
					activity. This article will analyse the current and future risks of leaving space debris unchecked,
					as well as detail potential mitigative proposals. A variety of academic and industrial research 
					was accessed, from theoretical models of space debris in the 1970s to more recent studies.

				 	Industrial waste is a constant and evolving challenge opposing industrialisation and 
					development. Mitigative measures can be employed to reduce the negative effects of waste on 
					earth, but the situation becomes much more complex when we consider human development 
					in space. The ‘industrial waste’ that we must deal with in space is Orbital Debris, which can
					cause huge amounts of damage if they impact our satellites and space stations. Debris can be 
					defined here as any artificial object discarded in orbit.  This paper will determine the extent to 
					which orbital debris is a threat to human development in space and analyse the proposed 
					measures to address this threat.

					The two primary sources of debris are staged rocket engines (Aglietti et al, 2019), 
					and decommissioned satellites (Klinkrad, 2006). This debris has the potential to collide and 
					multiply, creating a positive feedback loop. In 1978, Donald J Kessler posited that this effect 
					could eventually spiral exponentially, rendering some orbits unusable (Kessler, Cour-Palais, 1978).
					In the direst of outcomes, humanity could effectively be trapped on earth. This came to be called 
					the Kessler Syndrome.

<!LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY>

		<p class="ex1">
				<pre id="Legal_InText"; style="font-size:200%">
					There is currently insufficient legal framework to hold those who generate debris accountable. 
					The most recent legislative framework concerning this is the 1972 Liability Convention, which 
					states that any compensation for debris damage is to be done between governmental bodies 
					(Poonuganti, Sraavya, 2023) . This is quickly becoming outdated with the rise of international 
					space-faring corporations, and does not address the generation of debris in both the private and 
					public sector. For the 2023 Chicago Journal of International Law, Poonuganti and Sraavya suggest 
					a variety of measures, including expanding the definition of ‘space debris’, classifying abandoned 
					objects as stateless, such that any party can remove them, and implementing a ‘polluter pays’ 
					principle to space debris.

					Orbital debris collisions are a risk to objects in orbit around the earth. This phenomenon has been 
					explored in media, most notably in 2013’s ‘Gravity’, but the threat it poses is far from fiction. 
					The International Space Station has manoeuvred 32 times since 1999  to avoid collisions (Nasa, 2022),
					and minor collision damage is well documented. Figure 2 demonstrates how even small debris can 
					puncture through multiple protective layers.
					
					As the problem of orbit debris continues to worsen through increased launches, orbit collisions, and 
					the intentional destruction of satellites, the constraints on satellite design will increase, life 
					expectancy will decrease, and maintenance requirements increase drastically. This will put a 
					dampening effect on new launches and orbital developments. Further economic analysis suggests that 
					the falling profitability of new satellites due to the Kessler Syndrome will render certain orbits 
					economically unusable long before they become physically unusable due to debris (Adilov et al, 2018).
					
					With the rise of commercial space missions, and plans for private space stations (NASA, 2025), a 
					market is emerging for orbit cleanup methods and operations, and some testing is already underway in 
					this field. The RemoveDEBRIS mission was the first to demonstrate a variety of orbital debris removal 
					technologies ( Aglietti et al, 2019). Astroscale are a private sector firm who focus on capture and 
					deorbit of satellites through a docking system and are currently contracted by UK Space Agency 
					(Astroscale 2025).

<!Cleanup Methods>
		<hr>
			<h3 id="Cleanup Methods"; style="font-family:calibri">Cleanup Methods</h3>
		</hr>	

		<p class="ex1">
			<pre id="Cleanup_InText"; style="font-size:200%">
					There are various methods of Active Debris Removal (ADR). While there is much ongoing research and development 
					into ADR systems, only 3 methods of removal have been testing in real orbit environments. These are the 
					drag-sail, the net, and the harpoon. These were tested on the RemoveDEBRIS mission in 2018 at the ISS 
					(Aglietti et al, 2019).
				
					Drag-sailing is a method used to decrease the time in which a satellite takes to deorbit. The sail is 
					preinstalled and unfurls when it is to be deorbited. This method is mechanically simple and compact, which 
					increases reliability and cost effectiveness. The major constraint is that it only decreases deorbit time, and 
					does thus will not work on satellites that will eventually deorbit naturally.
				
					A deployed net is a method proposed to capture larger debris that have no deorbiting technology preinstalled. 
					The spring-launched net encapsulates the target for collection. The size can be easily scaled based on the 
					target, but could run the risk of becoming entangled in the target preventing complete capture. This may lead 
					to a lower reliability.
				
					The Harpoon works much the same in orbit as it does in our oceans. It is fired with compressed gas to reel in 
					the target. It was tested against common satellite material, and was found to puncture effectively, but snapped 
					the target during the test. This represents the risk of fracturing a target, creating more debris. Therefore, 
					the harpoon can only be used on appropriate materials.

		<!CONCLUSION>

		<p class="ex1">
			<pre id="Conclusion_InText"; style="font-size:200%">
					Space debris is a threat to spacefaring efforts that will only increase in severity the longer it is left unchecked. 
					The rapidly increasing space activity in the public and private sector, along with subpar legal frameworks to 
					hold these actors accountable risks an increase in the risks of debris damage, and may ultimately lead to 
					orbits being inaccessible, if the Kessler Syndrome comes into effect. Rising interest in economic space activity 
					has led to renewed focus on the way that space debris proliferation is tackled. Some Legal reform and removal 
					technologies are being suggested, and if these are fully implemented into the industry, they could redefine how 
					economic space activity is conducted.
