				Humanity utilises space for a variety of purposes, including communication, scientific study, and defence. As on earth, industrial utilisation of this environment creates waste. In orbit, this waste, or space debris, threatens to damage crucial infrastructure if collisions occur. This problem has been documented as early on as 1978, but legal and technological solutions have only ramped up in the last decade, likely due to an increased interest in commercial space activity. This article will analyse the current and future risks of leaving space debris unchecked, as well as detail potential mitigative proposals. A variety of academic and industrial research was accessed, from theoretical models of space debris in the 1970s to more recent studies.
