					Humanity utilises space for a variety of purposes, including communication, scientific study, and defence. As on earth, industrial utilisation of this environment creates waste. In orbit, this waste, or space debris, threatens to damage crucial infrastructure if collisions occur. This problem has been documented as early on as 1978, but legal and technological solutions have only ramped up in the last decade, likely due to an increased interest in commercial space activity. This article will analyse the current and future risks of leaving space debris unchecked, as well as detail potential mitigative proposals. A variety of academic and industrial research was accessed, from theoretical models of space debris in the 1970s to more recent studies.

				 	Industrial waste is a constant and evolving challenge opposing industrialisation and development. Mitigative measures can be employed to reduce the negative effects of waste on earth, but the situation becomes much more complex when we consider human development in space. The ‘industrial waste’ that we must deal with in space is Orbital Debris, which can cause huge amounts of damage if they impact our satellites and space stations. Debris can be defined here as any artificial object discarded in orbit.  This paper will determine the extent to which orbital debris is a threat to human development in space and analyse the proposed measures to address this threat.

					The two primary sources of debris are staged rocket engines (Aglietti et al, 2019),  and decommissioned satellites (Klinkrad, 2006). This debris has the potential to collide and multiply, creating a positive feedback loop. In 1978, Donald J Kessler posited that this effect could eventually spiral exponentially, rendering some orbits unusable (Kessler, Cour-Palais, 1978). In the direst of outcomes, humanity could effectively be trapped on earth. This came to be called the Kessler Syndrome.
